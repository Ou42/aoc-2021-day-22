# Operation Synonyms

In programming, naming is one of the two hardest challenges.  Here we're facing such a quandary in describing the operation of applying two cuboids together to get a result:

1.  Overlap 2 cuboids together to get a collection of cuboids
    representing the **union** of the overlap.
1.  Overlap 2 cuboids together to get a collection of cuboids
    representing the **difference** of the overlap.

What verbs to use to describe these two operations?  Here's a table of synonyms; choose one:

| **Union** | **Difference** | **Comment**                                      |
|:----------|:---------------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| `(+)`     | `(-)`          | Confusing with other uses of these operators?    |
| `add`     | `subtract`     | In one sense: precise, but multi-used elsewhere? |
| `augment` | `reduce`       | A little more CAD-oriented                       |
| `sum`     | `difference`   | I am kinda liking this one                       |
| *add..*   | *your..*       | *own!*                                           |
